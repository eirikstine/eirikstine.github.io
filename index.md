# Who're we?

We're a couple (Stine and Eirik) that loves teaching data science, programming, and mathematics. When teaching at the university level, we learned to polish our teaching abilities. 

We love to teach others new things and care a lot about many topics with technology and mathematics. We have made both full-scale courses on Udemy and free content on YouTube (scroll further down &#128512;).

# Our Full Udemy Courses

We've made full Udemy courses on the topics **Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**, **Scientific Computing with NumPy**, and **Academic Typesetting with LaTeX**. 

The courses are packed with informational videos, quizzes, exercises, projects, and more!

# What we have planned?

# Q & A

*   **Can I suggest a video topic to you?** - Of course! We can't promise that we will make it (maybe we don't feel confident in the topic), but we are always glad for suggestions! Simply make a comment on one of our YouTube videos suggesting another topic. We check all comments we get ü•∞

*   **Can I just find your courses by searching for them on Udemy?** - Yes, but we would prefer you to follow the links above. They use a promotional code "under the hood" so that you don't pay the full amount. Additionally, we get a larger share of the profits if you purchase the courses after following the links.
*   
*   **Could you not self-host courses rather than use Udemy?** - At the moment no, unfortunately. We don't have the (technical & mental) capacity to set up a full-scale hosting service with authentication, payment methods, content delivery, and so on. For now, you have to watch our full-scale courses on Udemy.
