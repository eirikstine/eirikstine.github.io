# Who're we?

We're a couple that loves teaching topics within data science, programming, and mathematics. When teaching at the university level, we learned to polish our teaching abilities. 

We love to teach others new things and care a lot about many topics with technology and mathematics. We have made full-scale courses on Udemy (scroll down) and free content on YouTube (scroll further down &#128512;).
