# Who're we?

We're a couple (Stine and Eirik) that loves to teach data science, programming, and mathematics üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®

For several years we have made video courses and love to take our experiences from offline teaching and apply them to create engaging courses!

We care a lot about many topics with technology and mathematics. We have made both full-scale courses on Udemy and free content on YouTube (scroll further down for both &#128512;).

# Our (Paid) Full Udemy Courses

We've made full Udemy courses that go into depth of interesting topics. 

The courses are packed with informational videos, quizzes, exercises, projects, and more üî•

# What we have planned?

Currently, we are working on a course about Linear Programming. We are super stoked about working on a course closer to mathematics ‚ú®

This takes a while, but it will hopefully be finished in 2025 and will be available on Udemy.

In the meantime, we are also making smaller videos and shorter courses on YouTube. Subscribe to our [YouTube channel]((https://www.youtube.com/@TMQuest)) to get updates on this on YouTube. 

# Q & A

*   **Can I suggest a video topic to you?** - Of course! We can't promise that we will make it (maybe we don't feel confident in the topic), but we are always glad for suggestions! Simply make a comment on one of our YouTube videos suggesting another topic. We check all comments we get ü•∞

*   **Can I just find your courses by searching for them on Udemy?** - Yes, but we would prefer you to follow the links above. They use a promotional code "under the hood" so that you don't pay the full amount. Additionally, we get a larger share of the profits if you purchase the courses after following the links.

*   **Could you not self-host courses rather than use Udemy?** - At the moment no, unfortunately. We don't have the (technical & mental) capacity to set up a full-scale hosting service with authentication, payment methods, content delivery, and so on. For now, you have to watch our full-scale courses on Udemy.
